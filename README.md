# 3DKneeNet
This repository contains the code for training and infering the TL net based CNN for 3D reconstruction of objects. 



## Overview
3DKneeNet is a latent embedding matching approach for 3D point cloud reconstruction from a single image. To better incorporate the data prior and generate meaningful reconstructions, first train a 3D point cloud auto-encoder and then learn a mapping from the 2D image to the corresponding learnt embedding. It can be shown that learning a good latent space of 3D objects is essential for the task of single-view 3D reconstruction.
